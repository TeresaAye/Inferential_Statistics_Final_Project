# Inferential_Statistics_Final_Project
Final Project for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Inferential Statistics Module

This is a project that I completed for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Inferential Statistics Module.
I used excel and Python to do my analysis, which is reported in the attached pdf document.

There is also a pdf document with the review by the Udacity team.
