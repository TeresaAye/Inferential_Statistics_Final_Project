# Inferential_Statistics_Final_Project
Final Project for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Inferential Statistics Module

This is a project that I completed for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Inferential Statistics Module.
I used excel and Python to do my analysis.

There are 2 pdf documents. One with the project results, and one with the review by the Udacity team.
